# Dreamland
A personal project. Use OpenCV, Ceres and Eigen to implement a flexible SfM framework.

All interfaces are designed as flexible as I can. 

So that we can evaluate different algorithms for every steps easily and quickly.

**This framework is still under development!**

# Dependencies
- OpenCV (>= 3.1)
- Eigen (>= 3.3)
- Ceres
- SiftGpu
- Boost and its Graph Library
